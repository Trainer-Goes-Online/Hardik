   The VSL SOP's downstream loop feeds Meta the revenue-quality signals that
   sit AFTER the ₹97 tripwire, so the algorithm optimises toward men who book,
   show up and buy the high-ticket — not merely anyone who pays ₹97.

   These names are LOCKED by the client (2026-08-11). Meta's ML needs naming
   stability, so once the Apps Script fires one of these it must never be
   renamed. Recorded here rather than in the Apps Script alone so the whole
   event vocabulary lives in one file.

   All four are CUSTOM events, deliberately lowercase_snake and PHI-free, to
   stay clear of the health-and-wellness standard-event restriction that
   already forces `sales` / `atc_event` / `ic_event` (see lib/meta-capi.js).

   When Layer 4 lands, these fire from Apps Script straight to the Graph API
   off the CRM sheet's lifecycle columns — no backend proxy. */
