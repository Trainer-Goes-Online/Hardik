/**
 * PROJECT ALPHA WELLNESS — all approved copy, in one place.
 *
 * Source of truth: "Hardik Project File.docx" (public/), the FINALISED funnel copy.
 * This file was rewritten from that document on 2026-08-10. Every string below is
 * reproduced verbatim from it, in its original order.
 *
 * READ BEFORE EDITING — four things the docx does NOT contain. Nothing was invented
 * to fill them, and nothing was silently dropped:
 *
 *   1. THE 73% CLAIM IS GONE. The previous draft carried "73% completely off the
 *      pill in 90 days" in five places. It does not appear anywhere in the finalised
 *      docx, so it has been removed rather than carried forward. If it is a real
 *      figure, it has to come back through the docx.
 *   2. THE MECHANISM SECTION (beat 6) has no source in the docx. Kept below and
 *      marked, because deleting a whole section is Atul's call, not mine. It is the
 *      only copy on the page that is NOT from the finalised document.
 *   3. hero.featurePills and hero.pointers have no source in the docx. Emptied, not
 *      invented. The markup renders nothing for an empty array.
 *   4. The expert CERTIFICATION and FEATURED links have no slot in the current
 *      founder markup. Held in founder.certifications so they are not lost.
 *
 * TWO TYPOS ARE REPRODUCED AS WRITTEN, flagged inline: "gloablly" and "Cholestrol".
 * Fix them in the docx and I will re-import; they are not corrected here because
 * this file must not diverge from the approved source.

   2. EVERY FACE IS BLURRED, Gaussian radius 13 on a 160px crop — dialled back
      from the first radius-16 pass on the client's call ("80%, not 100%"). Still
      unidentifiable at any zoom, but hair, beard and skin tone read enough that

     Kartik joins only when a consult needs him. Staying unnamed here avoids

   LEGAL PAGES — AUTHORED DRAFTS, NOT LEGAL ADVICE (2026-08-11)

   These were written because the funnel takes payment and collects health
   information, and had no policies at all. They are a competent starting draft
   in plain English, NOT a substitute for review by a lawyer qualified in the
   operating jurisdiction. Two things must happen before launch:

     1. Fill in `legalEntity`. Every page renders a visible warning banner while
        any field is null, because a policy with no identifiable entity behind
        it is unenforceable and, for a payment page, a compliance problem.
     2. Settle the refund terms. MISSING.refundTerms is still open: the 90-day
        money-back guarantee covers the PROGRAMME, and nobody has stated what
        happens to the ₹97 call fee. The refund page flags this rather than
        inventing an answer.
